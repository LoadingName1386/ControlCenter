Requirements:

+) Must have Rainmeter Installed

+) Must have DroptopFour installed either Basic or Supporter Version

+) That's all :)

+) How to install :

1) Run the .rmskin file

2) Go to Droptop Settings => Community App => Choose Control Center from one of the option

How to use it:
1) Left click the wifi icon will open the wifi action center in windows 11 and wifi settings menu in windows 10

2) Right click the wifi icon will open the wifi settings in Settings

3) Same goes for the bluetooth icon and the airdrop icon (It's not actually bluetooth and airdrop, it's the download and upload rate)

Right click the system icon will prompt with winver about windows

Right click the soundcloud icon will open the volume mixer menu 

That's all

Noticeable bug:
Using heavy blur will result in the menu be a litle big wider
Double clicking the quick settings icon will result in the menu being off from the icon

To solve this: right click rainmeter icon on the system tray

=> go to Manage

=> Navigate to the control center ini file in droptop community app 

=> Type in number 1941 and 41 consecutively in the 2 box

=> Diable all the tick and then press close on Rainmeter

Pls remember to press close when you are done or the settings will not be save
